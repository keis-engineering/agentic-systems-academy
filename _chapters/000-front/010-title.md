# About agents

AI Agents are software programs capable of:
- Interacting with their environment
- Collecting data
- Planning
- Making decisions based on data
- Performing predetermined goals
- Autonomously

## Architectural patterns
- [GenAI architectural patterns](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/generative-ai-architectural-patterns-debmalya-biswas-hlvye/)
- [Navigating Complexity: Orchestrated Problem Solving with Multi-Agent LLMs](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.16713v1)
- [3 Patterns in Agent Design](https://alexsniffin.medium.com/three-ai-design-patterns-of-autonomous-agents-8372b9402f7c)
- [Design Patterns with Autogen](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/ai-agentic-design-patterns-with-autogen/)


## Architectural types

### Simple Reflex Agents
- Simple reflex agents respond directly to stimuli from the environment without considering the history of the world.

### Model-based Reflex Agents
- Model-based reflex agents use a model of the world to handle partially observable environments.

### Goal-based Agents
- Goal-based agents act to achieve specific goals.

### Utility-based Agents
- Utility-based agents aim to maximize their performance measure through a utility function.

### Learning Agents
- Learning agents have the ability to improve their performance over time based on experience.

### ReAct Agent (Reason + Action)
- Combines reasoning and action to improve decision-making processes in AI agents.

### Task-Planner Agent
- Uses task planning to break down complex goals into manageable tasks for the agent to execute.

### Multi-Agent Orchestration
- Coordinates multiple agents to work together towards common goals, enhancing their collective performance.
